1- Files inside `asterisk_config` should be imported in `/etc/asterisk` configs : `extensions.conf`, `pjsip.conf`, `agents.conf`, and `queues.conf` using include statements.
For example, to include your custom dialplan and configuration edits in `pjsip.conf`, add the following line:
```
#include /var/lib/agi-bin/asterisk/HNO/asterisk_config/extensions_custom.conf
```
This ensures that the contents of `extensions_custom.conf` are loaded as part of your Asterisk configuration.


2- Ensure all these files are always owned by user and group `asterisk`. If needed, run:
```
chown -R asterisk:asterisk project_folder
```

```
